    A base NodeVisitor class for visiting c_ast nodes. 
    Subclass it and define your own visit_XXX methods, where
    XXX is the class name you want to visit with these 
    methods.
    
    For example:
    
    class ConstantVisitor(NodeVisitor):
        def __init__(self):
            self.values = []
        
        def visit_Constant(self, node):
            self.values.append(node.value)

    Creates a list of values of all the constant nodes 
    encountered below the given node. To use it:
    
    cv = ConstantVisitor()
    cv.visit(node)
    
    Notes:
    
    *   generic_visit() will be called for AST nodes for which 
        no visit_XXX method was defined. 
    *   The children of nodes for which a visit_XXX was 
        defined will not be visited - if you need this, call
        generic_visit() on the node. 
        You can use:
            NodeVisitor.generic_visit(self, node)
    *   Modeled after Python's own AST visiting facilities
        (the ast module of Python 3.0)
